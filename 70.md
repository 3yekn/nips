Signature Request Event
-------------------

`draft` `rfc` `optional` `author:3yekn`

An [ephemeral event](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/16.md#ephemeral-events) type with kind `20010` representing a peer-to-peer request for signature of a specific payload. 

The initial purpose of this event type is for requesting approval of [partially signed bitcoin transactions](https://river.com/learn/terms/p/partially-signed-bitcoin-transaction-psbt/) (PSBT), but the event type may also be used in more general purpose approval-style workflows.

### Motivation
Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, and Erika manage a company's bitcoin treasury that is used to pay vendors. The amounts are large, so the treasury is protected in a multisignature wallet. The payment frequency is low, so there is not a need for an L2 such as lightning. 

They often use popular bitcoin wallets such as Electrum or Sparrow to manage the treasury. These wallets require that a spending proposer export the PSBT to a text file, send the file out-of-band, where the prospective approver must then import the PSBT, sign, export, and repeat. Eventually, the PSBT or combination of signatures reaches the threshold for the transaction to be finalized and broadcast.

The treasurers wish to improve and streamline the process using Nostr and user-friendly policy editors such as BDK's [Elephant](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/elephant). 

#### Document Signatures
This feature set could replace common document approval/signature applications such as DocuSign. Instead of a PSBT, the content could be markdown or other information that represents the body of what is being signed by the user. Security of just 

### Notes & RFC
- The content may or may not be encrypted (?).
- It will likely be common for this to be used on private or permissioned relays.
- The `p` tag is for tagging a specific account, such as `@Bob` or `@Charlie`. It supports an text string for each account being tagged. See example below.
- Bitcoin signature request URIs have been proposed over the years but it is unclear how many wallets support them. The content in a `20010` event may contain a URI encoded PSBT or a non-URI encoded PSBT.

#### Example Client Implementation
Clients may show the event under DMs or in a specific signature-request zone.

Clients may add `Approve` or `Reject` or `...` (more) buttons directly in the client, or provide a URI to open the signature request within a bitcoin wallet (similar to the zap functionality).

### Example
This example event tags Bob, Charlie, David, and Erika with an optional note for each. The PSBT is in the content. Once signed the resulting PSBT can be the same event type as the signature is already embedded in the PSBT specification.
